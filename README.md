# SpaceAdventure

This is a basic game that takes a JSON planetary file and uses it to complete interactions with a user. The user's name is gathered and introduced, then the game prompts the user to explore and asks if they would like to choose a planet or randomly go to one. Either way, the game ends by printing out a travel and arrived statement.

The overall goal of this project is to become familiar with the Go language.
